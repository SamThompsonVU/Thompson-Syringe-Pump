# Build your own Syringe Pump!

## Assembly process

This syringe pump can be assembled using a 3D printer and materials you can order online.

Printed parts were modeled in Fusion360 and formed with PLA.

## Specifications

Sizes of individual components can be found in the bill of materials on the "mechanical" page.

This build fits a 20 mL standard syringe

With the code listed on this site, the stepper motor requires approximately 564 steps to extrude 1 mL from the syringe - a resolution of around 1.7 uL.
By utilizing microstepping features of the Arduino Uno, the steps/mL can be increased to approximately 9,029 - a theoretical resolution of 0.11 uL !

The max flow rate of this syringe pump is governed by mechanical factors such as the torque of the stepper motor and friction amongst moving parts as well as digital factors related to the processing speed of the Arduino's outputs. It will also ultimately depend on the viscosity of the fluid being extruded.
